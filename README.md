# Medibank Coding Challenge
Please find the required code in the file `search-directory.py`

To use this code, you need to replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual directory path you want to search through. The code recursively searches through the specified directory and its subdirectories, counts the occurrences of each word (case-insensitive), and then outputs the list of unique strings in descending order of occurrences, as long as the occurrence count is greater than 2.
